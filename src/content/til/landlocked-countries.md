A landlocked country is a country that does not have a coastline. Worldwide, there are 44 of them. **Kazakhstan** is the worldâ€™s largest, while **Ethiopia** is the most populous one.

A double-landlocked country, on the other hand, is a landlocked country that is entirely surrounded by other landlocked countries. There are only two double-landlocked countries in the world (**Liechtenstein** and **Uzbekistan**).
