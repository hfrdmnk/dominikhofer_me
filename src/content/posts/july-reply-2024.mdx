**Let’s connect more over blog posts. It’s #JulyReply2024!**

With two weeks passed since the launch of this website, I want to cultivate my blogging habit and make sure that I keep the flame of enthusiasm for writing on the IndieWeb burning. And what better way to do that than by joining my very first blogging challenge?

It’s #JulyReply2024, a challenge brought to life by [Robert](https://birming.com/). And it’s a love letter to the art of blogging, the community around it and getting inspired by each other. Whenever I come across an interesting post this month and want to reply to it, I will do so on this site. Like in an email thread, each of these reply posts will start with “Re: [Original Title]” (or “Re: Re: …”, depending on how many conversations a post sparks).

These posts can be long or short, but they will always be one thing: **Sincere and an appreciation of the original post and its author.**

## These are my entries:

- [Re: We Blog 24/7](/re-we-blog-24-7)
- [Re: AI Critics: You're Using It Wrong](/re-ai-critics-youre-using-it-wrong)
- [Re: To Read or Not to Read…](/re-to-read-or-not-to-read)

I will regularly update this list, so make sure to come back :)

Want to join the challenge yourself? Head over to [Robert’s post](https://birming.com/july-reply-blog/) to sign up, and share your replies with the **#JulyReply2024**.

Happy reply-blogging!
