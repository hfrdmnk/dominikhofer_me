September has been quite a busy month for me. You might have noticed that I started to post a little less frequently on this blog, which has a very specific reason: [Uni has started](/uni-start), and I am now trying to juggle everything from learning, working, relationships and hobbies as best as I can.

Since I committed to the [SeptemBest blogging challenge by Robert](https://birming.com/septembest-blog-challenge/), I still have one more blogpost to write for this month: The one where I show you the post I am most proud of this month, the one that was the best in my humble opinion.

Luckily, apart from all the things going on, I still managed to publish a few candidates. But I chose one that not only managed to capture my enthusiasm for a hobby of mine, but also seemed to resonate with quite a bunch of people over on Mastodon:

[The After-Run High](/after-run-high)

Especially during these first days of uni, where everything is new, exciting but also stressful, running serves as one of the best activities to keep my physical (but also mental) health in check.

As Iâ€™ve written in that post: 

> Every run improves your day, no matter how long it was and how you felt before or during the run.

So I keep running.
