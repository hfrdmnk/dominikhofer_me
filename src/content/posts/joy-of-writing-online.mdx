As I’ve stated before, writing regularly and publishing your work has many benefits. There’s one thing, though, that I didn’t really have on my radar, but that probably brings me the most joy.

Every now and then, a piece of writing resonates with someone and that person even decides to share it. Either by posting a reply or a link to the piece on their website, or by reaching out directly via email.

I’m using Plausible Analytics on this website. Not so much for the numbers, but more so for the referrers. Whenever I see an unknown personal website in this list, a sense of wonder arises: “Who is this person and why have they decided to share or write about my posts?” This usually leads to discovering more great personal websites.

And then, there’s email. It doesn’t happen that often, but when I see one from someone in my inbox who reaches out in response to a post[^1], it’s always a pleasure to read. For example, I’ve had someone reach out and recommend me more similar books when I published “[Inconveniences of everyday life](/inconveniences-of-everyday-life)”. What a pleasant surprise!

The internet is smaller and more personal than you think. Even a bigger blogger (namely Rahul from [Hulry](https://hulry.com/)) has reached out a couple of weeks ago, which felt almost surreal.

It’s just interesting to see, how many great and likeminded people you get to know, once you start putting yourself out there.

To spread the word, I decided to put together this small list of people with awesome personal blogs, who have personally reached out to me over the last year or linked to mine from their site[^2]. Just click on their name and pay them a visit!

Thanks y’all for making the web a better place 🫶

[^1]:	I’m honestly writing response emails way too rarely myself, but I’m trying to make it more of a habit.
