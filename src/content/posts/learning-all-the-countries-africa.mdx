Inspired by my girlfriend and my brother, who are both somewhat huge geography buffs, I’ve decided to challenge myself to learn all the countries in the world. I would say I already have decent geography knowledge, but compared to them, I’m still in noob territory. The end goal is to be able to complete the [“Countries of the World”-quiz on Jetpunk](https://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/lander-der-welt-quiz).

I started with Africa because it’s such a huge continent that I know embarrassingly little about.

Whenever I have trouble remembering a country, I usually look it up on Wikipedia and try to find one interesting fact about that state, that helps me form a better mental connection.

So here is my list of interesting facts about some countries in Africa:

Over 90 percent of the **Algerian** population lives along the Mediterranean coast (that is only 12% of the total land mass).

**Botswana** has been very successful economically recently and has been dubbed the “Switzerland of Africa”. It’s also the oldest democracy in Africa.

**Burkina Faso** has Ouagadougou as their capital (my grandmother taught me this at a very young age, and it stuck with me ever since because it sounds so iconic).

**Djibouti** has many foreign military bases because of its strategic location on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes.

**Equatorial Guinea** is the only country on the continent that has Spanish as their official language.

**Eswatini** used to be called Swaziland until 2018. One of the reasons was because foreigners apparently confused it with Switzerland. The official spelling is eSwatini.

**Ethiopia** is the most populous landlocked country on earth.

**The Gambia** is the smallest country in continental Africa and named after the Gambia River. It wanted to merge with **Senegal** at one point (Senegambia Confederation).

I found this interesting video, that explains, [why there are so many Guineas](https://youtu.be/7Zed-g6dbZ8): **Guinea**, **Guinea-Bissau**, **Equatorial Guinea** and also Papua New Guinea in Oceania.

**Liberia** was the first African republic to proclaim its independence.

**Sierra Leone**’s capital is Freetown, which is essentially the same name as **Gabon**’s capital Libreville, just in English instead of French.

Within **Somalia**, there is the unrecognized country Somaliland.

**South Sudan** is the youngest country in the world (2011) and plans to have a new capital, that doesn’t even exist yet (Ramciel).

**Sudan** has more pyramids than **Egypt**.

**Tanzania** is the result of the union between the former states Tanganyika and Zanzibar.

**Uganda** is where the Nile originates.

Do you have any more interesting facts about African countries that you want to share with me? Please [send them my way](/hello)!

See you in the next note about the next continent I’m gonna tackle: Asia.
