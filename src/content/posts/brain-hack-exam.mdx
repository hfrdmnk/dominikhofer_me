I’m currently in the middle of exam season and wanted to share a quick tip that helps me enormously when I get nervous or tense right before a quiz. It also helps with studying in general or whenever you have something important coming up.

It sounds far too simple, but listening to the soundtracks of iconic movies (mainly ones by Christopher Nolan) just does something to my brain.

Whenever I’m on my way to an exam, the last two songs I always listen to are:

**Time** by Hans Zimmer (from Inception)

**Can You Hear The Music** by Ludwig Göransson (from Oppenheimer)

Just a couple of minutes to let my mind wander to another world, and I’m ready for whatever real life has to offer.
