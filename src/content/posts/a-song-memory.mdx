You know about these playlists that Spotify auto-generates for you based on a mood or activity?

Usually, when I go for a run and don’t want to listen to my own running playlist, I throw on one of these running mixes. They’re great. There are even different versions for different tempos, so I can always choose one that fits my run.

Occasionally, it so happens that I rediscover a song I haven’t listened to in a long time. And with that, sometimes also a nostalgic memory.

Yesterday, I went for my run fairly late for my standards. The sun was already setting when I took off. Which also means that I ran the second part pretty much in the dark.

But these are the perfect moments to rediscover an old song memory. I love the solitude when running through nearly empty streets, just the streetlight guiding my way. Focusing on my strides, my breath, just thinking about [the next step](/only-the-next-step-matters).

I was already on the last 500m, when “Animals” by Martin Garrix came on. You probably know the song, it’s quite energizing. And I felt that energy and immediately picked up my pace one final time. It felt amazing.

As I was almost sprinting towards my home, I remembered again, how I first heard this track. The song came out in 2013, which means I wasn’t even a teenager back then. But there are two things I quite distinctively remember about it:

1. The music video. It felt so iconic to me, with that clock in the beginning that then becomes an element of the beat. I’ve watched it countless times at the time because back then, I didn’t have Spotify, and we only bought songs very occasionally through my dad’s iTunes account.
2. Martin Garrix himself. One fact I always remember about him is that he was only 16 when he made it.

This was one of the first times when I heard that some random teenager created something so groundbreaking essentially from his bedroom.

I don’t listen to this track particularly often anymore. But with every encounter, it reaffirms my belief, that anyone can create great things. The only things that matter are the willingness to learn, to make mistakes and, most importantly, to just keep creating.

So, thanks for the memory, Spotify.
