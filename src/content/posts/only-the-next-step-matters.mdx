When I’m out running and don’t feel great, I always try to focus on just the next stride. And then the next one. And the next.

It pulls me back into the moment, makes me more present, and before I know it, a couple 100 meters have passed already.

What works for running also works for life in general.

Once you have a rough plan on what you need to do (a quick brain dump is usually enough), just take the first step. Focus on it, and the result will be better than if you were overthinking it.

Or at least you will be faster. Which leaves more time for iterations and gathering feedback.

And once you’re done, just take the next step. And the next. It’s all that matters right now.
