Sometimes, you want to load a file into your web project via a CDN. But what do you do, if the docs don’t give you that CDN link?

There is a very easy solution to this problem that uses a service called “JSDelivr”. Just go to the projects Github page and locate the file you want to use.

Then, copy its url (just the one you see in the browser). Remove everything up to (and including) /blob/main. You should end up with a path like this: `/path/to/file/script.js`.

Your final step is to add `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{reponame}`in front of the path and voilà. You got yourself a blazing fast CDN link!

## An even easier solution

While writing this note, I came across this handy tool on JSDelivr’s own website: https://www.jsdelivr.com/github. It automatically converts your Github links into CDN ones. Just paste the Github url and you’re good to go!
