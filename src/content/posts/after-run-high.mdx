I just came back from a 15k run, and I feel great.

I didn’t feel great before the run, though. Having to run 15 kilometers on a Saturday morning doesn’t sound like a lot of fun.

But luckily, this feeling only lasts for the first few 1’000 meters. After around ¼ of the run, everything feels lighter and smoother. I’ve found my natural stride and am steadily increasing my pace.

Usually, these long runs tend to be progressive. Which translates to a slow-ish start, but you pick your pace up every x kilometer, depending on the length of the run. Today’s run, for example, looked like this:

- 5 km warm-up pace
- 5 km 5:05 min/km pace
- 4 km 4:55 min/km pace
- 1 km cool-down

In such a run, typically during the hardest effort, something wonderful happens: You experience a Runner’s High. It sounds kinda spiritual, but in this state, your body, and mind work together perfectly, despite the hard effort. The body taps into its last reserves, while the mind releases endorphins. It’s the first reward of a long run.

The second one happens after the run is finished. Immediately when you stop running, you might not feel particularly great but rather exhausted (at least I do). But after some stretches, taking a shower and slipping into clean clothes, I have that feeling of an “After-Run High”. That’s not a real term, but it sounds cool and fits the sensation.

No matter how my day will go from that point on, I have already done something good for myself – for my body but also for my mind. I’m in a relaxed state and way more motivated to do the things I’m supposed to do.

Ultimately, it all boils down to two things:

Every run improves your day, no matter how long it was and how you felt before or during the run.

And, the harder the effort, the better you feel afterward. That doesn’t only apply to running, but everything worth doing in life. Putting time, energy and will-power at something will always pay off eventually.

So, take out your running shoes and go for a run. You won’t regret it!
