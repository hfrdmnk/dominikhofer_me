I was listening to a [Deep Dive episode with Nathan Berry](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ybpRD02MyT76tCyHnOQYj) (CEO of ConvertKit) as a guest. And there was this one quote by him, that really resonated with me[^1]:

> It’s simple, not easy.

He was saying this in the context of writing 1000 words every day[^2]. But I thought to myself, that this mantra actually applies to everything in life, that will have a sustainable impact on the quality of it:

- Eating clean food.
- Exercising every day.
- Using your smartphone less.
- Getting off Social Media.
- Journaling.
- Coding daily.
- Reading a book a month.
- Spending quality time with loved ones without any distractions.
- Sleeping 8 hours every night.

It’s simple, not easy.

[^1]: Around the 01:20:00 mark

[^2]: He did this for 600 days a couple of years back.
