With the use of the [WebFinger protocol](https://webfinger.net/), you can make your Mastodon account discoverable via your own domain. Without hosting a separate Mastodon instance.

For example, my Mastodon account is `dominik@mastodon.design`. But when you search for `toots@dominikhofer.me`, you’ll also find my profile[^1].

Here’s how you can add this functionality relatively easy to your own Astro site. The approach also works for other frameworks, the specific code just might look a bit different. You can always [reach out to me](/hello), and I’ll see, how I can support you!

## Preparation 
Your Mastodon instance gives you the exact JSON, you need for this to work. Just go to `https://[your_instance]/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:[your_username]@[your_instance]` and you should be greeted with a JSON object. Mine is for example under [https://mastodon.design/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:dominik@mastodon.design](https://mastodon.design/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:dominik@mastodon.design).

Save both the link and the JSON response somewhere, we’ll need it later.

## Static method
This method uses a static Astro endpoint. This means that it will ignore anything that comes after the `?` in the url and always serve the same JSON. So `toots@dominikhofer.me` will work, just as `posts@dominikhofer.me` or `justarandomuser@dominikhofer.me` will.

We will have to follow the same directory structure as Mastodon, though.

So in your `src/pages` folder, create the `.well-known` directory (with the dot!) and add a `webfinger.ts` file within.

This file then contains the JSON you copied earlier and a GET function, that just serves that JSON when someone (or something, like Mastodon) looks for your WebFinger.

Here’s a template for you to copy:

```ts
// Endpoint for WebFinger
const WEBFINGER_JSON = {} // replace {} with your full JSON object

export async function GET() {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(WEBFINGER_JSON), {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/activity+json",
    },
  });
}
```

You can now open [https://localhost:4321/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:youruser@yourdomain.com](https://localhost:4321/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:toots@dominikhofer.me) and should see your JSON object on screen.

## Dynamic method
The dynamic version is just a bit more complicated to implement, but has the added benefit of allowing you to specify multiple users on your domain. So you could create a `toots@youdomain.com` as well as a `photos@yourdomain.com` user for your Pixelfed account. This is possible because the endpoint now respects the resource parameter after the `?` in the url.

It only works though, if you deploy your project in `server` or `hybrid` mode. You can find more infos about this [in the Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/).

Just like with the other method, we need to create the `webfinger.ts` file within the `src/pages/.well-known` directory.

The file then looks something like this:

```ts
// Endpoint for WebFinger requests
export const prerender = false;

// Edit this array
const ACCOUNTS = [
  {
    username: "toots",
    redirect:
      "https://mastodon.design/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:dominik@mastodon.design",
  },
  // ... more users here
];

const hostname = "yourdomain.com";

export async function GET({ request, redirect }) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const resource = url.searchParams.get("resource");

  if (!resource) {
    return new Response("Bad request", { status: 400 });
  }

  for (const account of ACCOUNTS) {
    if (resource === `acct:${account.username}@${hostname}`) {
      console.log(account.redirect);
      return redirect(account.redirect, 301);
    }
  }

  return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
}
```

One thing that is crucial is that you put `export const prerender = false;` at the top of the file if you have set your `output` in your `astro.config.mjs` file to `hybrid`. 

You can then add as many users in your `ACCOUNTS` array as you please. Just remember that the redirect has to be the `.well-known` link from Mastodon (or another Fediverse platform) you copied earlier.

When Mastodon now reaches out to your server to look for `toots@yourdomain.com`, this function will resolve this user to the appropriate redirect and thus return the correct JSON.

If someone is looking for `nonexistenuser@yourdomain.com` a 404 error will be returned.

That’s already it, now you have Mastodon on your own domain without hosting a server! If you need some further help, take a look at the [source code of this website](/repo) or [reach out to me](/hello). I’m happy to assist you in setting this up.
