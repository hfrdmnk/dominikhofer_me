> We "blog" even when we are not sitting in front of a computer screen. We see or hear something, draw parallels to our lives, and make a mental note of it. Then, when the opportunity arises, we sit down and create something unique based on our history.

This immediately reminded me of something James Clear talks about in his bestseller “Atomic Habits”. When establishing a new habit, you first have to take on a new identity. Acting according to your new identity will then lead to you being able to establish the habit way more easily.

It’s fascinating, how much this small shift in your thinking can influence your behaviour. For example, when I learned to code and began to understand the magnitude of possibilities this opened, my brain automatically began searching for issues in everyday life that I could solve with code.

Just today at work, I had to find out on which pages an instance of a class is present in a Webflow site. Since Webflow doesn’t offer such a search functionality natively (and I was far too lazy to go through each of the 20+ pages manually), I just threw together a quick Node.js script that did it for me in 20 seconds. How great is that?

_(As a side note, that’s also the reason I’ll never catch up with my “coding project ideas”-list – the ideas never stop coming.)_

Same with blogging: When I started to write my first posts back in spring, I started a new list in Things 3 titled “Blogpost Ideas”. I just took a look right now, it still contains 60 ideas that I haven’t even touched yet.

So when Robert states that _“We ‘blog’ even when we are not sitting in front of a computer screen.”_, I 100% agree.

It’s like flipping a switch in your mind that you can’t turn back. And I love that!
