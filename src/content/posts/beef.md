I finally finished watching Beef on Netflix yesterday. And wow, what a great show!

But the weird thing was, that I couldn’t really pinpoint, _what_ exactly I found great about it.

Sure, from a cinematography standpoint, it’s made brilliantly. The actors were great as well, just as the music selection (especially the [montage at the end of episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GU3CuhkTyU) felt really emotional).

But what I’ve come to think is that the real reason this show was a great watch, was its rawness. It felt like a snapshot into the life of the characters. Their struggles, wishes, and desires. And the writing was so great, that each character was almost equally like-/hateable (with a few exceptions maybe).

At its core, it’s an everyday story told in a very compelling and relatable way. Partly also because it's [inspired by the show runner’s (Lee Sung Jin) personal life](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/lee-sung-jin-beef-series-inspiration).

I want to watch and read more such stories in the future. A breath of fresh air between all the blockbuster movies I normally go watch at the cinema.
Do you have any recommendations that have a similar vibe?
