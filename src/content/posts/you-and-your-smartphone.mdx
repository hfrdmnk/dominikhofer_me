YouTube recommended me this video by Dan Go:

[https://youtu.be/F2pEQlUmKWc](https://youtu.be/F2pEQlUmKWc)

An interesting piece in general, but two things really stuck with me:

> Your brain is a piece of software. Consistently upgrade it.

> Your body is a piece of hardware. Consistently upgrade it.

What a great metaphor! 

You also regularly update the OS of your smartphone (hopefully) and also upgrade the hardware (aka buy a new one) from time to time. Why wouldnâ€™t you want to do the same with yourself?

Especially the software, your brain, can be updated an unlimited number of times.

Take advantage of that. Learn new things, create something, challenge yourself!

The human brain is the most fascinating and powerful thing we know of. [Neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity) allows it to evolve and change its structure throughout your entire life.

Use it or lose it.
