Inspired by [Jedda](https://notes.jeddacp.com/spotify-wrapped-2024/) and in the spirit of sharing and discovering great music, I also wanted to write a bit about my Spotify Wrapped this year.

Every song is linked, so you can directly listen to it on Spotify. Enjoy, and [let me know if you also like one of these](/hello)!

## Top Songs

### 1. [Lost My Mind](https://open.spotify.com/track/0fdfXWcW9BFBGsdk7fh0B5) – BUNT., Elley Duhé
This song was already in my 2023 Wrapped and climbed even higher this year. I simply like BUNT.’s style (as you will also see later), but this one is my absolute favorite track of his. It also reminds me a lot of my [Seoul trip last year](/cities-i-want-to-visit-again), as I’ve listened to it a lot there while I was strolling through the bustling streets. Maybe that’s the reason I had this one on repeat for over a year now.

### 2. [9 bis 9](https://open.spotify.com/track/5YWu6dt50Nieq8qi572RF8) – SIRA, Bausa, badchieff
I don’t listen to German music particularly often, but 9 bis 9 is a track that just gives me good vibes every time I hear it. It sounds like the feeling you get when you spend a warm summer evening with good friends to me.

### 3. [Solo](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Skkx52Dh8yo4G1ijAEGs3) – Myles Smith
Myles is my artist discovery of the year. My favorite track of his is actually [Stargazing](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Vr3zh0r7ALn8VLqCiRR10), but it came out after Solo, which was already in my heavy rotation by then. So I can only recommend that you check out both songs ;)
I’m actually going to a concert of his next spring and am really looking forward to it! [His shows seem great](/favorite-live-performances), from what I’ve seen so far.

### 4. [Clouds](https://open.spotify.com/track/5985LToyqbVWWNczsD9g5N) – BUNT., Nate Traveller
Another great song by BUNT., although not as special to me as the first one in my opinion. Still, a very great choice for picking up the pace when going for a run.

### 5. [Somewhere Only We Know](https://open.spotify.com/track/1SKPmfSYaPsETbRHaiA18G) – Keane
This one is quite the outlier in the list, since it’s already over 20 years old. I rediscovered it because of this one great montage in Beef ([one of my favorite series this year](/beef)) and it has been in my heavy-rotation ever since. You probably know it as well, but it never hurts to re-listen to great songs.

What was your song discovery this year? [I’d love to know](/hello)!

[^1]:	Delilah seems to be a great choice for a song title!

[^2]:	Give this one a listen if you want to hear, what a not-so-serious Swiss-German song sounds like.
